# Budget Tracker 9.0 Release Notes

## Major Performance Update - April 25, 2024

Version 9.0.0 brings significant performance improvements and stability enhancements to the Budget Tracker application. This update focuses on improving the overall application performance, fixing memory leaks, and enhancing user experience with more responsive interfaces.

- **Memory Usage**: Fixed multiple memory leaks throughout the application, resulting in reduced RAM usage over time
- **DOM Manipulation**: Combined and optimized DOM-related code for better performance

### Bug Fixes

- **useEffect Dependencies**: Fixed missing dependencies in `useEffect` hooks that could cause stale data or unnecessary renders
- **Form Validation**: Enhanced form validation with optimized validation functions 
- **Autosave Functionality**: Fixed memory leaks in autosave feature with proper cleanup
