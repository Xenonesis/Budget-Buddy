### Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Anonymous requests**: 100 requests per hour
- **Authenticated requests**: 1000 requests per hour
- **AI endpoints**: 50 requests per hour (higher computational cost)

Exceeding rate limits will result in a 429 (Too Many Requests) response.

### Error Handling

All API responses follow a consistent error format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Human-readable error message",
  "error_code": "MACHINE_READABLE_ERROR_CODE",
  "details": {
    "field": "value"
  }
}
```

### Webhook Integration

Budget Buddy supports webhook notifications for real-time updates:

#### Supported Events
- `transaction.created`
- `transaction.updated`
- `transaction.deleted`
- `budget.exceeded`
- `goal.achieved`
- `ai.insight.generated`

#### Webhook Configuration
```json
{
  "url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/budget-buddy",
  "events": ["transaction.created", "budget.exceeded"],
  "secret": "your-webhook-secret"
}
```

Webhooks are signed with HMAC for security verification.

### Contribution Guidelines

#### Code Style

We follow strict coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency:

- **TypeScript**: Use strong typing wherever possible
- **React**: Follow modern React patterns with hooks and functional components
- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive, consistent naming for variables, functions, and components
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments for complex logic
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs and complex functions

```typescript
// Good example
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  amount: number;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  date: Date;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
}

// Bad example (missing typing)
const transaction = {
  id: '123',
  amount: 25.99,
  description: 'Coffee',
  category: 'Food',
  date: new Date(),
  type: 'expense'
};
```

#### Testing

Quality code requires comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test how components work together
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain at least 80% test coverage

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/components/Button.test.tsx

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Documentation

Keep documentation up to date with code changes:

- **Inline Comments**: Explain complex logic and algorithms
- **JSDoc**: Document public functions and classes
- **README Updates**: Update README for new features
- **API Documentation**: Update API reference for new endpoints

#### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format for clear, structured commit history:

```bash
# Feature additions
feat: add dark mode toggle

# Bug fixes
fix: resolve transaction date parsing issue

# Documentation updates
docs: update API reference for transactions

# Performance improvements
perf: optimize transaction loading by 30%

# Refactoring (no functional changes)

# CI configuration changes
ci: update GitHub Actions workflow

# Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

# Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
chore: update dependencies
```

#### Pull Requests

Create detailed, high-quality pull requests:

1. **Descriptive Title**: Clear, concise title that summarizes changes
2. **Detailed Description**: Explain what changed, why, and how to test
3. **Screenshots**: Include before/after screenshots for UI changes
4. **Related Issues**: Link to related GitHub issues
5. **Checklist**: Complete the PR checklist before submitting

### Database Development

Working with the database requires understanding our schema and migration process:

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Example table structure
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category TEXT,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('income', 'expense')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Migration Process
```bash
# Create a new migration
npm run db:create-migration "add_transaction_categories"

# Run pending migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Rollback last migration
npm run db:rollback

# Reset database (warning: deletes all data)
npm run db:reset
```

### API Development

When adding new API endpoints, follow these guidelines:

#### API Route Structure
```typescript
// app/api/transactions/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth';
import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  try {
    // Authentication
    const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
    if (!session) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { success: false, error: 'Unauthorized' },
        { status: 401 }
      );
    }
    
    // Implementation
    const transactions = await getTransactions(session.user.id);
    
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      transactions
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching transactions:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { success: false, error: 'Internal server error' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
// Standard error response format
interface ErrorResponse {
  success: false;
  error: string;
  error_code?: string;
  details?: Record<string, any>;
}

// Success response format
interface SuccessResponse<T> {
  success: true;
  data: T;
}
```

### UI Component Development

When creating new UI components, follow these patterns:

#### Component Structure
```tsx
// components/ui/Button.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
}

export const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant = 'primary', size = 'md', ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <button
        className={cn(
          'inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md font-medium transition-colors',
          {
            'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700': variant === 'primary',
            'bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-300': variant === 'secondary',
            'bg-red-600 text-white hover:bg-red-700': variant === 'danger',
          },
          {
            'h-8 px-3 text-sm': size === 'sm',
            'h-10 px-4 py-2': size === 'md',
            'h-12 px-6 text-lg': size === 'lg',
          },
          className
        )}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    );
  }
);

Button.displayName = 'Button';
```

#### Component Testing
```tsx
// components/ui/Button.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from './Button';

describe('Button', () => {
  it('renders with correct text', () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('applies correct variant classes', () => {
    const { container } = render(<Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>);
    expect(container.firstChild).toHaveClass('bg-blue-600');
  });

  it('handles click events', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);
    screen.getByText('Click me').click();
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```

### Documentation Updates

Keep documentation up to date with your changes:

#### README Updates
- Update feature lists when adding new functionality
- Add new sections for major features
- Update screenshots when UI changes
- Update installation instructions when dependencies change

#### Code Documentation
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the total amount spent in a given category
 * @param transactions - Array of transaction objects
 * @param category - Category to calculate total for
 * @returns Total amount spent in the category
 * @throws {Error} If transactions array is invalid
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const total = calculateCategoryTotal(transactions, 'Food & Dining');
 * console.log(total); // 250.75
 * ```
 */
function calculateCategoryTotal(
  transactions: Transaction[], 
  category: string
): number {
  // Implementation
}
```
