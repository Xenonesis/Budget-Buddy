The page.tsx contains: Header, HeroSection, FeaturesSection, TestimonialsSection, PricingSection, CTASection, AboutSection, Footer. It uses dynamic imports for animation components (FeatureBubbles, TestimonialBubbles, CTABubbles) with loading placeholders. All components are properly organized in the components/landing directory. The page-animations.tsx contains optimized bubble animations with reduced motion support.","Created a new sections.tsx file that organizes all landing page sections with a reusable SectionWrapper component. Refactored the main page.tsx to use a cleaner, more maintainable structure with a configuration-driven approach for sections. All existing functionalities are preserved including animations, dynamic imports, and responsive design.","Successfully refactored the landing page with improved organization and cleaner code structure. All animations and interactive elements are preserved through the SectionWrapper component. TypeScript compilation passes without errors. The refactored code maintains all existing functionalities including: dynamic imports for animations, loading placeholders, responsive design, mobile optimizations, and all section components (Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, CTA, About)."],"modified_files":["/mnt/c/Users/addy/Downloads/Budget-Buddy/components/landing/sections.tsx","/mnt/c/Users/addy/Downloads/Budget-Buddy/app/page.tsx","/mnt/c/Users/addy/Downloads/Budget-Buddy/components/landing/sections.tsx","/mnt/c/Users/addy/Downloads/Budget-Buddy/app/page.tsx"],"id":"1759256838789"}
